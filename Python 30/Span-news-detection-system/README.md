# Span News Detection
This [project](https://github.com/nasim-raj-laskar/pyth-30/blob/main/Python%2030/Span-news-detection-system/main.ipynb) focuses on detecting fake news using machine learning techniques. It is designed to process and classify news articles based on their content to identify whether they are fake or genuine. The project leverages a [dataset](https://github.com/nasim-raj-laskar/pyth-30/tree/main/Python%2030/Span-news-detection-system/dataset) with labeled news articles, which are preprocessed and then fed into a machine learning pipeline to train a classification model. Key features of the project include:


## Tools Used

1. **Data Handling**: `numpy`, `pandas`  
2. **NLP**: `nltk`, `re`  
3. **Vectorization**: `TfidfVectorizer`  
4. **Machine Learning**: `MultinomialNB`

# Emotion Recognition System

This project implements a real-time emotion recognition system using a pre-trained model. It captures live video feed from a webcam, analyzes each frame to detect facial emotions, and displays the results in real-time. The system leverages the `facial_emotion_recognition` library for emotion classification and OpenCV for video processing.

## Tools Used
- **facial_emotion_recognition**: For pre-trained emotion detection.
- **OpenCV**: For video capture and image processing.

# Heart Disease Analysis Using Naive Bayes Classifier

This [project](https://github.com/nasim-raj-laskar/pyth-30/blob/main/Python%2030/Heart-Disease-Detection/heart-disease-prediction.ipynb) focuses on predicting the likelihood of a patient having heart disease using a machine learning model. The [dataset](https://github.com/nasim-raj-laskar/pyth-30/blob/main/Python%2030/Heart-Disease-Detection/datasets/heart.csv) includes various medical parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The Naive Bayes classification algorithm is used to perform predictions based on these features. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

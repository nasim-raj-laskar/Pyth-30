# Road Sign Detection

This [project](https://github.com/nasim-raj-laskar/pyth-30/blob/main/Python%2030/Road-Sign-detection/main.ipynb) is a deep learning-based traffic sign recognition system developed using TensorFlow and Keras. The model leverages the pre-trained MobileNetV2 architecture for feature extraction and is fine-tuned to classify German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) [dataset](https://github.com/nasim-raj-laskar/pyth-30/tree/main/Python%2030/Road-Sign-detection/dataset) images into 43 distinct classes.


## Tools and Libraries Used
- **TensorFlow and Keras:** For building and training the deep learning model.
- **OpenCV:** For image preprocessing and real-time predictions.
- **Matplotlib:** For visualizing accuracy and predictions.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.

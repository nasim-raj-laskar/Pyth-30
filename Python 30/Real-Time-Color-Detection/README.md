# RealTime Colour Detection

This [project](https://github.com/nasim-raj-laskar/pyth-30/blob/main/Python%2030/Real-Time-Color-Detection/main.py) is a real-time color detection and recognition application developed using Python. The program captures live video feed from a webcam and analyzes the color at the center of the frame. It identifies the color in HSV space, displays its RGB and HSV values, and provides a stable color reading by maintaining a history of detected colors.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **OpenCV:** For video capture, frame processing, and annotations.
- **Python 3:** Programming language for implementing the logic.
- **Collections (deque):** To maintain a history of detected colors for stable color recognition.
- **Time:** For calculating frames per second (FPS).

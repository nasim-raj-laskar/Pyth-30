# Object Recognition

This project utilizes OpenCV's deep learning module to perform real-time object detection through a webcam feed. The MobileNet SSD model is used for identifying and classifying objects in the captured video frames. Each detected object is displayed with a bounding box and label, indicating the object class and confidence level. The system is designed to detect various objects like cars, people, animals, and more.

## Tools Used
- **OpenCV**: For video capture, image processing, and object detection.
- **NumPy**: For handling numerical operations and image arrays.
- **Imutils**: For simplifying image processing tasks.
- **MobileNet SSD**: A pre-trained deep learning model used for object detection in images.

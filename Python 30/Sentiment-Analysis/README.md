# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

This project implements a sentiment analysis model for predicting movie review sentiments as either positive or negative using a deep learning approach. The model uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architecture to process text data and classify movie reviews into binary sentiment categories.

## Tools Used


- **Python**: The primary programming language used to build the sentiment analysis model.
- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis (e.g., loading CSV, data cleaning, etc.).
- **scikit-learn**: Provides functions for model evaluation (e.g., confusion matrix, train-test split).
- **TensorFlow (Keras)**: Used for building, training, and evaluating the deep learning model (LSTM network).
- **Matplotlib**: Used for plotting training and validation accuracy/loss graphs and confusion matrix.
- **seaborn**: Used for creating a heatmap of the confusion matrix.

# Object Tracking

This [project](https://github.com/nasim-raj-laskar/pyth-30/blob/main/Python%2030/Object-Tracking/project.py) is an object tracking application developed using Python. The application detects and tracks objects of a specified color (red in this case) in real time using a webcam feed. It identifies the object's position, calculates its radius, and prints directional guidance based on the object's position within the frame.


## Tools and Libraries Used
- **OpenCV:** For image and video processing, contour detection, and drawing shapes.
- **Imutils:** For resizing video frames efficiently.
- **Python 3:** Programming language for implementing the logic and operations.

# Face Detection Project

## Description

This project demonstrates a basic face detection system using OpenCV. The script uses a Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in real-time from a webcam feed. When a face is detected, the system draws a rectangle around it, highlighting the identified face. The webcam captures frames continuously, and the face detection is applied to each frame to identify faces.

The program runs in a loop, continuously displaying the webcam feed with the detected faces until the user presses the "Esc" key to exit.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: The programming language used to implement the face detection system.
- **OpenCV**: A powerful library for computer vision tasks, used here for reading images, converting them to grayscale, and detecting faces.
- **Haar Cascade Classifier**: A machine learning object detection method used in OpenCV to detect faces in an image.

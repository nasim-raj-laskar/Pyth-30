This [project](https://github.com/nasim-raj-laskar/pyth-30/blob/main/Python%2030/Vehicle-Tracking/car.py) performs vehicle detection and traffic monitoring using computer vision techniques. A pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier is utilized to detect cars in video footage, enabling the analysis of vehicle density in specific regions. Based on vehicle count, simple traffic control decisions are suggested (e.g., indicating traffic levels and red signal alerts).

## Tools Used

- **Python**: Programming language for image processing and video analysis.
- **Libraries**:
  - `OpenCV`: Image and video processing for object detection.
  - `imutils`: Simplifying image processing tasks like resizing.
- **Haar Cascade Classifier**: Pre-trained [model](https://github.com/nasim-raj-laskar/pyth-30/blob/main/Python%2030/Vehicle-Tracking/cars.xml) for vehicle detection.

# Wikipedia Text Analysis


This [project](https://github.com/nasim-raj-laskar/pyth-30/blob/main/Python%2030/Tag-Identification/main.py) performs text analysis on the content of a Wikipedia page. By extracting and cleaning the textual data, the program identifies the top 20 most frequently occurring words, excluding common stop words. The results are visualized using a bar chart to display word frequencies.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Programming language for text processing and analysis.
- **urllib**: For fetching webpage content.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing and extracting text from HTML.
- **nltk**: For natural language processing, including stop word removal and frequency distribution.
- **matplotlib**: For visualizing word frequencies in a bar chart.

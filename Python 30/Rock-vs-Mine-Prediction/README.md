# Sonar Mines vs Rocks Classification

This project implements a classification model to distinguish between sonar readings that represent rocks and mines. The dataset consists of sonar signals captured from a sonar system, and the goal is to predict whether the signal represents a mine ("M") or a rock ("R"). We use machine learning techniques to build a predictive model based on the features derived from these sonar signals.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used to build and run the classification model.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and exploration, such as loading the dataset and performing basic analysis.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations, including data transformation and handling arrays.
- **scikit-learn**: Used for implementing the machine learning model (Logistic Regression), as well as for data splitting, model evaluation, and metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

# S&P 500 Prediction and Analysis

This [project](https://github.com/nasim-raj-laskar/pyth-30/blob/main/Python%2030/Stock-Market-Prediction/main.py) focuses on predicting future trends in the S&P 500 index using machine learning techniques. Historical market data is analyzed to classify whether the index will close higher or lower compared to its previous close. A Random Forest Classifier is employed to make predictions, and the model's performance is evaluated using precision scores and backtesting. Additionally, the project explores the incorporation of rolling averages and trend indicators to improve predictive accuracy.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for data manipulation and machine learning.
- **pandas**: For handling and analyzing time series data.
- **yfinance**: To fetch historical S&P 500 data.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing the Random Forest Classifier and evaluating model performance.

# Energy Consumption Prediction using XGBoost

This [project](https://github.com/nasim-raj-laskar/pyth-30/blob/main/Python%2030/Energy-Consumption-Forecasting/main.ipynb) predicts hourly energy consumption (in MW) for PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland) based on historical [data](https://github.com/nasim-raj-laskar/pyth-30/blob/main/Python%2030/Energy-Consumption-Forecasting/PJME_hourly.csv). The [dataset](https://github.com/nasim-raj-laskar/pyth-30/blob/main/Python%2030/Energy-Consumption-Forecasting/PJME_hourly.csv) contains energy usage information, and through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, the project aims to accurately forecast future energy demand. The model was built using the XGBoost algorithm, which is effective for regression tasks due to its boosting capabilities. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using evaluation metrics and visualizations.

## Tools Used
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For visualizing the dataset and model predictions.
- **XGBoost:** For building the prediction model using gradient boosting.
- **Scikit-learn:** For data splitting, model evaluation, and metric calculation.


## Visualizations

### 4. **Feature-Target Relationship**

These boxplots display the relationship between the `hour` and `month` features and the target variable `PJME_MW`. They help understand how energy consumption varies by time of day and month.

- **MW by Hour** and **MW by Month**

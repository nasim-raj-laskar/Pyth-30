# Diabetes Prediction

This [repository](https://github.com/nasim-raj-laskar/pyth-30/blob/main/Python%2030/Diabetes-prediction/diabetes_prediction.ipynb) provides a complete implementation of a machine learning pipeline for predicting diabetes based on patient medical records. The pipeline includes model training, evaluation, and deployment using a neural network built with Keras. It demonstrates data handling, model serialization, and visualization of evaluation metrics such as confusion matrices and classification reports. The project is designed to showcase the integration of machine learning techniques with Python libraries, making it a robust tool for binary classification tasks.

## Tools Used
- **NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Keras**: For building and training the neural network model.
- **Pandas**: For creating dataframes to store and analyze results.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For generating evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix and classification report.

# Titanic Survival Prediction


This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not. Using machine learning techniques, we preprocess the data, handle missing values, visualize relationships, and implement a Naive Bayes classification model to make predictions based on passenger features such as class, gender, and age.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and model building.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: Numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: Data visualization.
  - `missingno`: Visualization of missing data.
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning model implementation and evaluation.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks.

This project demonstrates a Python-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system that extracts text from images using Tesseract. The script processes a given image file, extracts text content, and appends the recognized text to a specified text file. The project is ideal for automating tasks that require reading text from images, such as digitizing labels or processing scanned documents.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the OCR functionality.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Python Imaging Library for image processing.
- **Tesseract OCR**: Open-source OCR engine for text recognition from images.
- **Tesseract-OCR Executable**: Installed on the local system and integrated via Python's `pytesseract` library.

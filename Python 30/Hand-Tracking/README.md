# Hand Tracking

This [project](https://github.com/nasim-raj-laskar/pyth-30/blob/main/Python%2030/Hand-Tracking/main.py) utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to perform real-time hand gesture recognition using a webcam. By leveraging the powerful hand tracking model provided by MediaPipe, the script is capable of detecting hands in the webcam feed and extracting key landmarks from them. These landmarks are essentially specific points on the hand, such as the tips of the fingers, the wrist, and other important regions, which can be used to understand the hand's position and movements.

In its current form, the project captures video frames, detects hand landmarks, and displays the hand landmarks in the form of dots connected by lines on the webcam feed. The FPS (Frames Per Second) is also calculated and displayed on the screen to monitor the real-time performance of the hand detection process.
